You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Technical Test
### First part
#### Wishlist implementation :
- user can add a product to his wishlist
- user can remove a product from his wishlist
- user can navigate to a dedicated page with all products saved in the wishlist

#### This is a frontend lead job offer, pay attention about UI, UX of course but also web performance issues and potential bottlenecks.

### Second part
You have to reproduce this component : 
![Blissim card component](/public/static/images/card-component.png "Blisism card component")
You can choose similar fonts and the image is available in the public folder.
You can positioned the component on the homepage instead of the "lorem" text.
#### Keep in mind that most of the content on our site is customizable by teams and comes from a back office. It's not hardcoded.
